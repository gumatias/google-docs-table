# Description

The purpose of this library is to provide simpler ways for manipulating table and its contents in Google Docs.

This solve for the difficulty myself and [a few others](https://github.com/tanaikech/node-gdoctableapp) had when attempting to manage tables on Google Docs using the Google Docs V1 API. 

## Features

- Create table with values in rows and columns

## Some Missing Features

- Read table values
- Update table values
- Delete tables, rows and columns

## Usage

```

```

## Language Support

There are more fleshed out libraries in other languages that I found helpful when researching prior to deciding to build the first piece of the puzzle for Ruby.

- [go-gdoctableapp](https://github.com/tanaikech/go-gdoctableapp)
- [node-gdoctableapp](https://github.com/tanaikech/node-gdoctableapp)
- [gdoctableapppy](https://github.com/tanaikech/gdoctableapppy)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'google-docs-table-factory'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install google-docs-table-factory

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
